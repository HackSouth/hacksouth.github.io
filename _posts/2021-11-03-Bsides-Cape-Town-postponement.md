Currently, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding Lockdown restrictions for the beginning of December as the inevitable fourth wave approaches.

### 2021 Conference Plans
The plan was for a hybrid conference, but because of the lockdown uncertainty and, more importantly, since the previous BSIDES Cape Town took place in 2019 (2 years ago!), the organisers decided that an in-person conference would be superb. Therefore, the December 2021 BSIDES Cape Town conference has been postponed to March/April 2022 to allow for both an in-person conference and in-person workshops.

This extension does not change the plans for December 2022 BSIDES Cape Town, which will still occur. In the meantime, to cure your BSIDES Cape Town withdrawal, you can find the recordings of previous talks on the [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BSidesCapeTown/videos)

The organisers will be in touch with the speakers in the coming weeks to confirm availability with the extension.
Instead of the conference, there will only be a small meetup on or around the 4th of December; we will give more information closer to the date.


### Conclusion
We want to thank everyone who got in touch to volunteer and those who responded to the CFP; We will be in touch to check whether you can attend the meetup.
Please share this among the community so that everyone is aware!
