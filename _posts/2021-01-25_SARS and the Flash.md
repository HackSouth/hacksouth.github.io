In 2017 Adobe announced it would discontinue support for [Adobe Flash](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) from 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player on 12 January 2021 many have been caught unprepared. [SARS/South African Revenue Services](https://www.sars.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx) recently announced it would start using its own Browser. We aim to tackle the challenge this presents and what to think about and also why with a 2+ year warning things are not in place. <!--more-->

`Since Adobe no longer supports Flash Player after 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning 12 January 2021, Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems.  

Some users may continue to see reminders from Adobe to uninstall Flash Player from their system.  See below for more details on how to uninstall Flash Player.`

### What is flash and what is it used for?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#:~:text=Adobe%20Flash%20is%20a%20multimedia,%2C%20video%20games%2C%20and%20applications.) it states:

`Adobe Flash is a multimedia software platform used for production of animations, Rich web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games, and applications. It allowed streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input. ` 

In a basic sense, it helps run animated content. SARS has used it to work with forms and do eFilling.
