After many years of faith service, Adobe announced in 2017 it would discontinue support for [Adobe Flash](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) from 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player on 12 January 2021 many have been caught unprepared. [SARS/South African Revenue Services](https://www.sars.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx) recently announced it would start using its own Browser. We aim to tackle the challenge this presents and what to think about and also why with a 2+ year warning things are not in place. <!--more-->

### Whats going on?
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) announced back in 2017 that it would be EOL'ing (End of Life) Flash and this discontinue support (Including vulnerability management) and block Flash content from 12 January 2021. It stated quote:

`Since Adobe no longer supports Flash Player after 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning 12 January 2021, Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems.  

Some users may continue to see reminders from Adobe to uninstall Flash Player from their system.  See below for more details on how to uninstall Flash Player.`

End quote.

### What is flash and what is it used for?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#:~:text=Adobe%20Flash%20is%20a%20multimedia,%2C%20video%20games%2C%20and%20applications.) it states:

`Adobe Flash is a multimedia software platform used for production of animations, Rich web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games, and applications. It allowed streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input. ` 

An article was also published by [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/700229/adobe-flash-is-dead%C2%A0heres-what-that-means/) highlighting Adobe Flashes life and why it is going away forever.

When Flash was first introduced some 25 years ago, it was one of the only ways to make dynamic content available to the end user on the internet. Technology has vastly grown since then and the IT community saw many vulnerabilities in Flash over time. To illustrate this point, see this article by McAffee Research. Adobe has accordingly sunset Flash as of December 2020 so it was a surprise to many when the ship did not want to leave the SARS dock. For many years, SARS has used it to provide users with the ability to work with forms and do their eFilling. 

### Why does SARS use Flash

### Why is SARS continuing use of Flash and how?

Just a note on the tech here - SARS has rolled their own browser based off of chromium. I downloaded and unpacked the MSI file and there are references to chromium.


Modernisation and digitisation has been a become a rather steep mountain to climb that should have been a few steps on a monthly basis. Back in 2018 SARS Chief Officer for Digital and IT Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane gave an interview on eNCA after taking over from suspended commissioner Tom Moyane. The interview sadly did little to show citizens that things were being rectified.

### How does this affect me and is it bad?

The three most popular browsers today are Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Vendors of these browsers spend a considerable amount of time and money keeping them secure. Despite this, bugs are frequently found in them. See for example [this](https://threatpost.com/firefox-chrome-edge-bugs-system-hijacking/162873/)
When vendors patch these bugs, IT departments frequently have control of their environment and ensure that their users update their browsers accordingly. 

### Summary

We were warned and have known about the EOL of Adobe Flash for many years, including SARS. SARS has had problems with digitization and modernization and this is a cross roads for the state run revenue services and left many uninformed and ill prepared.

SARS has decided to continue using an unsupported version of Flash to it, and its users peril.

[How to Geek - Adobe Flash is Dead: Here’s What That Means](https://www.howtogeek.com/700229/adobe-flash-is-dead%C2%A0heres-what-that-means/)


On January 12 2021 Adobe blocked Flash Player. Since then the race has been on to deploy SARS’s latest, their own browser.
 
With Flash Player no longer supported due to it being legacy and vulnerable to potential attacks.
You can access the following forms on Adobe Flash post December 2020 included: Registration (excluding Registration for Individuals), Transfer Duty, Dividends Tax, Submission of Financial 3rd Party Data, Excise Duties and Levies.
A list of vulnerabilities from Flash included but not limited to : Adobe Flash Player : List of security vulnerabilities (cvedetails.com)
With financial year end around the corner, SARS is under pressure for their browser deployment not to fail, with millions watching and with lots on the line, from both a cyber security risk, traffic influx to come and agile approach for any bugs that may be found.
“In the age of Covid-19, social distancing and remote working, tax practitioners, business owners and members of the public are unable to visit Sars offices and rely heavily on virtual systems to get things done. “
 
As good as this is, there are also points of awareness for individuals and companies alike. This opens up a whole new world of government based software deployment and a nation itself vulnerable to a new world of cyber and all that comes with it, both good and bad.
