### The History    

Hack South was started for various reasons. [@AngusRed](https://twitter.com/AngusRedBlue) who is fairly well involved in the wider hacker community in South Africa had seen the various offshoots, factions and segmented groups of people. Different people have different conversations in various places. Whatsapp Groups, Slack Workplaces etc etc. Everyone seemingly with their own purpose and agenda. After realizing the true value of Discord and having some dramas on a well know Slack Workspace for South Africans, @AngusRed decided to take a leap and attempt to bring all the people together in 1 place, dedicated to infosec, devoid of bias, misconception, corporate rivalry or rank on the proverbial pecking order of the community.  

From this innitiative, Hack South was born. A server, on Discord dedicated to the entire past, present and future generation of hackers, tinkerers and enthusiasts that South Africa has to offer. Early on we took a stance to keep it focussed and centric to South Africa, then evolving it to Southern Africa. We also decided that we would welcome internationals, but that the core values and direction of the community would be focussed on Sout Africa.  

Initially Hack South was established on Slack with the help of [Hypn](https://twitter.com/HypnInfoSec) who runs [0xCoffee Cape Town](https://0xc0ffee-cpt.co.za/) due to the simple fact that most people will have access to Slack during their work day, and might not have access to Discord. With this thought process and understanding we went forth into the fray.  

The server grew steadily for a few weeks, but the limitations of Slack vs the benefits of using Discord (Categories, Roles, Voice Chat and UI/UX) became apparent fast. It was then decided we would set up a Discord. We would run both in situ, but after a few weeks decided to stay focussed on the discord and slowly shut down the Slack.  

On a 12 March 2020, before COVID19 hit us, we got geared up and set up the server on Discord. The initial build was with [AngusRed](https://github.com/AngusRed) and [Megladon](https://twitter.com/IPmegladon). We tried to carbon copy the Slack and added a few bits. We wanted it to be a well oiled machine. [The Many Hats Club](https://themanyhats.club/) was a big inspiration and point of Guidance for the build. Categories were being created, channels spun up, roles flying left and right until it got into a shape that we felt confident with.   

The first people to join Hack South was [Fenrirsec](https://twitter.com/SecFenrir) who was kekked for some reason, Shadowrizla and [Megladon](https://twitter.com/IPmegladon).

From here, an invite was issued, and the Hack South Originals joined, numbering 13 in that first week. You will know them on the serve by the GOLD Role, **Hack South Original** 

### The Early days  

**The Nazi raid**

The early days were crazy. We got excited with each person joining, many of which we knew. The server was not pushed at all. On the 13th of March 2020, we had a Nazi Raid. Angus was on his way to the airport to pick someone up when he got a Whatsapp from a friend, [Mooncake](https://twitter.com/GeoffChisnall) who told him there was a Raid spreading Nazi propaganda. We were clearly not ready. AngusRed then posted in Main saying ***"Who wants MOD"*** and immediatly 4 People were assigned MOD and started fixing perms, banning raiders and resolving the chaos. Those for were

After the dust had settled, we decided to keep pushing, keep building and grow the server.  

**Uncle Cyril and the lockdown  

With a small group of us we started monitoring COVID19 and cases in South Africa. Back when each case was recorded with detail. Back in the days were a daily increase of 5 people was big.
