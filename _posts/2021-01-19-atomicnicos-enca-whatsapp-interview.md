<h1>~$ eNCA Interview on the WhatsApp Privacy Policy Changes</h1>

<p>I had the distinct privilege of being interviewed on eNCA yesterday !</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.enca.com/" target="_blank">eNCA</a> -- a.k.a. e-News Channel Africa -- is the first and most watched news service in South Africa. You can imagine that it came as a bit of a shocker to me to receive a message request in my Twitter DM's from one of their guest bookers, asking me if I'd like to come on and discuss these policy changes. So I decided to do it:</p>

<p>A great thank you to the host (Dan Moyane) for their professionalism, as well as their accurate and neutral questioning. Remaining in the same observational stance as my article -- and not a confrontational stance -- allowed us to cover a lot of ground and enabled  me to additionally dispel a few myths and hoaxes while I had a platform. I know it may not have seemed to be a professional interview (mainly due to my part in it), but it was an opportunity for honest and open discourse, and that alone is quite humbling for me. I wish to extend my thanks to eNCA for taking the time to view privacy as an important matter, important enough that it should be discussed on their platform.</p>

<p>I can only hope that people got enough material from that interview to start an open and honest discourse on matters important to society as we move forward in a world where we cannot live without Big Tech.</p>

<p>As for how I had landed in their field of vision, I only know a part of the story:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Vocally criticizing the WhatsApp policy in voice chat on Hack South.</li>
  <li>Discussing this with <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/uid883"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> Christo</a>  alongside <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BeeFaauBee09"><i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i> Ibad (Bee)</a> on HackSouth (<a [routerLink]="['/postx/2021/2021_01_09+WhatsApp-Privacy-Policy-Changes-Discussion-at-Hack-South']" target="_blank">see here</a>).</li>
  <li>Publishing <a [routerLink]="['/postx/2021/2021_01_08+WhatsApp-Privacy-Policy-Changes-Analysis']" target="_blank">my article</a>.</li>
  <li>?</li>
  <li>Getting the proposition.</li>
</ol>

<p>Many thanks to those that spread my article and gotten me there, you have had a significant impact in my life.</p>
