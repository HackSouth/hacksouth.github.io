### Giving Back
As part of our vision and mission to connect the infosec community in Cape Town and get new people involved, we would like to give back to the community.

We already have the rite of passage initiative to find and assist up an coming students interested in information security, but to add to our initiatives we would like to give away a number of tickets to people who cannot afford the conference. 

We don't want finances to be a blocker to meeting interested and curious future hackers. No matter who we are, all of us started somewhere and someone had to take a chance with us.
