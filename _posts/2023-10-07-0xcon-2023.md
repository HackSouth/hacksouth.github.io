## 2023 Year in Review: Threads of nation-state dystopia - Jared Naude
Retrospectives are a great tool to look back at past events to understand what went right and what went wrong. In doing so, we can identify lessons that can be learned and what needs to be improved. This talk will be focused on analyzing the major cyber security events of the past year along with insight, analysis, and commentary on what it means for the wider cybersecurity community. 2023 saw a massive shift in the strategy and playbooks of state sponsored actors in targeting, tactics, and methods. 

In this talk, we will discuss the impact and significance in the shift of nation-state activity while looking at events of the past year, even if they are not nation state related. Some of the topics and events that will be covered in this talk include the following: How Ukraine has countered Russia’s cyber and disinformation, how Russia is struggling with Chinese technology, the US’s overreaction to TikTok, Chinese state-sponsored activity into US critical infrastructure and US department emails, the rise of commercial spyware and its implications, why the Cyber-Safety Review Board (CSRB) is doomed to fail, the impact of adversarial AI and LLMs, cross tenant cloud vulnerabilities, troubling privacy legislation; and the impact of lost key material.

## ed2root - how ancient IPC mechanisms can help you today - Connor du Plooy
This talk will go over how I found a vulnerability in a text editor on MacOS. Other variants of this vulnerability have been identified in other packages as well, and even though the APIs used by these packages have been deprecated for a really long time, it is still around in some software. 

The vulnerable component is exposed over IPC, so the talk will be broken down in to the following sections:

* An introduction to the vulnerable component (+- 5 minutes)
* A brief demonstration of the vulnerability (+- 2 minutes) (how to get root from a text editor)
* A primer to show how the software can be identified by combining static/dynamic analysis techniques (+- 2 minutes) 
* QAs

Key Takeaways:

* Why using deprecated APIs is always a bad idea
* How to identify vulnerable software 
* Understand the abstractions you build on

## Let the Children play - Leveraging AD CS for persistence and profit in Parent-Child configured forests - Tinus Green
In 2021, Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) came under scrutiny because of the opportunities it provides attackers for credential theft, domain and forest privilege escalation, and persistence. Since then, it has become a household name for red and blue teams alike. Unintended consequences and additional attack avenues are continually being discovered. This talk will cover new discoveries in this space from two perspectives:

* Lateral Movement - Noisy compromises of the Parent domain through Golden or Diamond tickets to get to other Child domains are a thing of the past
* Cross-Domain Escalation - A newly discovered default permission misconfiguration allowing forest-wide persistence from any Child domain

This talk will not only demonstrate these newly discovered attacks and the tooling released to exploit them, but also provide insights into mitigation methods that can be applied to close these attack avenues and the detection methods that can be used to discover them.

*About Tinus*

Tinus is currently the Head of Consultancy, where he leads the entire consultancy division, including all service areas and the research division. Previously he was the Service Lead for the Network Security and Application Security divisions and second-in-command for these services globally.

## Noooooooooo touch! - Michael Rodger
A few years ago, a new addition to the standard lineup of access control equipment quietly appeared - the humble “No touch” sensor. These mostly replaced physical buttons, the typical use case being letting yourself out from the “inside”, where the “outside” would have some form of control such as a keypad, RFID scanner, biometrics, etc. Naturally if you were already inside, you wouldn’t have to authenticate yourself to leave.
Fast forward to 2020 and “things you didn’t have to touch” were all the rage, so these started popping up all over the place (according to my observations). I was curious as to how they worked, and whether the range could somehow be manipulated. I had a hunch that they functioned by reflecting infrared light of some sort and I confirmed this by buying one and taking it apart. I came up with an idea to brute-force these to open with an external light source, and then high-powered infrared LED behind a lens to extend the range significantly. This was attractive because they are frequently placed on “inside” of glass doors where the “outside” requires authentication, so having a high-powered “no touch blaster” would let you into places you shouldn’t be :)
My initial research revealed that they seem to be more secure than I’d hoped, so I’m now less confident that beating them is even possible, but I have a few more ideas around what could be tried.
At a minimum, this will be a talk about taking a piece of hardware and dissecting it to figure out how it works, and essentially security testing it. General hardware security methodology and my journey from wondering, to opening, to what I learned about the devices. Best case scenario, I find a method that works and talk about the weaknesses and end up with a gadget in my red-team bag of tricks.

Also, the title is “noooooooo touch” with 10x o because the extended range, so I’m _really_ not touching it.

*About Michael*

Starting out as an electronic engineer, I quickly learned that my penchant for disassembling things and figuring out how they functioned also meant that I liked breaking things.
I joined the dots to infosec and since around 2013 I’ve been involved in the ZA hacker community. I’ve been helping with conference and meetup organising and badge building for most of the time since then, and in 2023 I made things official by joining the research team at Orange Cyberdefense.
I still tinker with hardware every chance I get, either fixing or improving something I have, or building something new. I’ve already come to terms with the consequences I’ll one day face when I teach my 2 small kids to question and dismantle everything, although my wife has already put a moratorium on bringing home broken electronics because “I’m sure I can fix this”.
I don’t like long walks on the beach because the sand gets everywhere and it smells like fish. I do like mountain biking though. Sorry, did you say “brief?”


## This Wide World of Consent - Jonathon Everatt
With the advent of cloud based technologies and identity management solutions; as well as the widespread adoption of these technologies by businesses and users has introduced new attack vectors that malicious actors can try abuse. One of these is a new type of phishing, called consent phishing.

In Consent Phishing,  an attacker-controlled application requests dangerous or sensitive permissions over a user's account or organisation's tenant. The goal of Consent Phishing is to gain the necessary authorisation (consent) over an aspect or portion of a user's account. The consent grants are managed through an Identity Provider using the OAuth 2.0 framework; examples of these technologies would include Azure, Facebook, and Discord.

This talk will explore the concept of consent phishing and utilise examples of consent phishing in Azure to illustrate the explanation. The talk will focus on both the offensive perspective and the defensive perspective of the attack and its relevant indicators of compromise. The talk will also show a high-level investigation of how other technologies tackle the problem of consent phishing.

## Hacking for Humanity - Matthew Hughes
Have you ever tried your hand at GeoGuessr, the online game that challenges you to guess your location from random street views? In my talk, I'll unveil the surprising connections between the problem-solving skills used in this game and the world of hacking and cybersecurity.

My journey started with GeoGuessr, where I noticed how similar the way we think during the game is to the thought processes of hackers and cybersecurity experts. It was like learning to hack the real world without realising it!

During the talk, we'll delve into the fascinating world of seemingly ordinary photos and videos on the internet. I'll emphasise why it's crucial for all of us to be cautious about what we share online. You'll also hear real-life examples of how geolocation, the art of figuring out locations based on clues, has been used to find terrorist compounds and provide crucial evidence in missing persons cases.

But it's not all about risks. I'll also demonstrate how we can harness geolocation skills for positive purposes. Through this research I was able to develop an AI tool using machine learning that can analyse and identify street bollards, a key factor in geolocation.

Join me for this talk, where we'll explore the intriguing connections between a simple online game and the dynamic world of geolocation in cybersecurity.

## GIT your secrets? - Isak van der Walt
This will be the same talk as I presented at 0xcoffee, with some minor updates if time permits.
The talk covers three primary aspects:
- A technical overview of how the git version control tool works.
- Some inherent and typical security issues related to git.
- Prevention and resolution of the prior demonstrated issue.

This talk does not contain any "new" research but rather just a full presentation of the git internals, the known inherent vulnerabilities and their resolution - all of which have been previously documented.

The first section aims to provide an overview for people not familiar with git, before diving into the building block - so called "plumbing" - tools utilized by git to perform its version control. This serves to provide a better understanding for the vulnerabilities as well as how to better utilize git.

The second section covers inherent vulnerabilities such as lack of author validation and secrets in version control histories, some of which will be accompanied with a basic demonstration. This also provides a baseline for what to look for from a defender's perspective

Finally the preventative measures and resolutions will be covered to address the aforementioned issues. Some simple measures in addition to the knowledge of the vulnerabilities can vastly reduce most of the surface area and risk associated with the covered vulnerabilities.
