A few weeks back a few of us took part in the TraceLabs, missing person CTF. It would be our 4th shot as a **Hack South** Team, but this time, we scored a podium finish and just missed out on P2. This is the story of how we did it, with no case specifics.

[![the team](assets/images/EksR_IFW0AQMgp4.jpg "The Result")](https://twitter.com/hack_south/status/1317972571837636608?s=20)

### What is this?
*Crowdsourced OSINT*
[TraceLabs](https://www.tracelabs.org/about/what-we-do) is crowdsource open source intelligence through both the Trace Labs OSINT Search Party CTFs and Ongoing Operations with their global community. Their highly skilled intelligence analysts then triage the data collected to produce actionable intelligence reports on each missing persons subject. These intelligence reports allow the law enforcement agencies that we work with the ability to quickly see any new details required to reopen a cold case and/or take immediate action on a missing subject.  

### Why do we do it?  
So the team has been a mix of people throughout the last few tournements. AngusRed has been a constant in many. We all do these for different reasons. We do these to learn a new skill that we can take into the professional world, we do this to win but always staying mindful of the real world application and effect of the result from finding previously unknown intel that can lead to someone being found, dead or alive to bring closure to the families.    

The CTF is rather bitter sweet. There are moments of cheer and exhilliration on finding a new point of entry for intelligence (Finding a new Social Media profile not found before) but we are often brought back to the stark reality of the circumstances surrounding the cases and the possible trauma this has brought to the friends, family and businesses that are affected.    

We typically start this CTF with a mindset to have fun and learn something, and then if our initial work is good, we do this to win, but that determination and result often stems from identifying and submitting high quality intelligence that can lead to finding a missing person or at least newer sources of intel for law enforcement to follow up with and either find the child/person or close a case do to passing.   

### Can I do this?  
So firstly we need to understand the path to entry. Prior experience needed is none, all one needs to understand what OSINT is. Next it is advised to use things like a VM, SOCK Accounts (Social Media accounts not linked to you, ergo fake accounts). In all honesty, you could use your own accounts and a smart phone if you really had to, although it is not advised.    

Next one needs to uderstand the *"[Rules of Engagement"](https://www.tracelabs.org/about/search-party-rules)* and the simple rule is what we call *Zero Touch* which basically means, do not interact with any of the intelligence that you find. If you find a private Instagram account, do NOT follow it. Law enforcement can run with it as they wish.    

Next piece is important. It is crucial you understand what you might find and the nature of it. You might find underage children commitiing crimes, might find things of a violent or sexual nature. It is important to keep this all at an arms reach.     

Lastly you need to understand what the end result is. As with most forms of intelligence, you typically want to know what the end result should look like. To get to that result you will typically gain as much intel about the subject, and once that is exhausted, you start looking at ancillary people and information. Siblings, family, parents, partners, work etc etc. You can go down one path, and that can lead to another, but go down too many asides you soon find yourself down a parth of irrelevance. The way I see it is if the intel adds value, i keep upping the degrees of seperation between the subject and wherever I am, when I feel it is going nowhere I slowly step closer to the subject in degrees of seperation till I am back on the subject and can then identify new avenues.     

### What now and how do I do this? 

So now you understand what needs to happen, now what?  

TraceLabs is set up through a self built application called Saigar. Saigar is basically where cases get loaded and contestants can read up on the case and surrounding info before they start hunting. There are also pages to understand the points structure, rules and some resources along with the all mighty scoreboard.    

As the clock strikes you will have between 5-12 cases. How we do it is use a seperate discord server with a VC channel we all stay on, and then cases are broken down by their own categories. We also use a trello with 10 case "boards" and 10 sections for the various points categories. As we find intel we log them in both and with good reason. Typically I [AngusRed](https://twitter.com/AngusRedBlue) will assign cases to everyone. At about the 2 hour mark we will switch to each others cases. We work together and collaborate. We do sanity checks which typically involve corroborating that one profile matches to a certain person or profile picture.  Often the first piece of intel is the hardest, IE getting a "Foothold" on a profile of the subject. We will help each other just get a start, especially if someone gets stuck. Keeping the team motivated is key.    

### How do you win?    

This is the $400-$900 question. Below is some things I have learnt helps towards this effort.    

**1 Piece of intel, multiple points categories**   
Hack South as a community has taken part in 4 TraceLabs Missing Persons CTF's. The first one we had 2 teams and placed 43rd and 57th respectively, the next we had 1 team that placed 31st, the next 7th and the last one we placed 3rd. The biggest change we made was understanding the points system. Understanding what can be seen as points worthy intel is key. Submitting at the highest possible level is important and also understanding that a single piece of intel can be submitted multiple times using different categories.  

*For eg.*   
Imagine a selfie of a girl, using a mirror and she is smoking a joint whilst showing off a new tattoo that was previously unknown and taken/uploaded post missing date on a new unknown social media account?  
**500** pts *Day Last Seen* - The photo is taken post missing date  
**150** pts *Advanced Subject Info/Habit* - The subject is smoking weed which can be seen as habit. Whether its legal or not, it is a habit  
**150** pts *Advanced Subject Info/Unique Identifiers* - The subject has a new and visable tattoo  
**150** pts *Advanced Subject Info/Brand of Cellphone* - If you can identify the brand, you are golden    
**150** pts *Advanced Subject Info/Make of cellphone* - If you can determine the model of phone, jackpot    
**50** pts *Social Media handles/accounts* - You found one of the subjects sock accounts    

Right there, in 1 photo we have 1150 Points on the scoreboard. Seperate to this you can trying look in the background of a photo to see if there are any other clues. Study the categories and points. After the 3rd place CTF I relooked the scoreboard and realized on one subject I missed about 400 points on some of the low ball points (10's and 15's). 


**Dont hoard, commit!**  
Next piece of advice is commiting to the submission. I always want to corroborate a piece of intel to make sure I can unequivocally link it to the subject. To be frank, this is not your job. If you believe it is intel, you submit it. It is up to the judges to decide its validity. Bear in mind many of the judges will have multiple teams that they are judging so perhaps someone else subbed the same intel and further linked to that original, that validates it. Just because you didnt see the link, does not mean you will not. Leave it to the judge. Some people tend to feel uncertain about a piece of intel or start questioning how this piece of intel might be relevant. This simple fact is that you are an unqualified intel analyst competing in a competition. You are not law enforcement, nor is this your assigned case nor do you have juristiction to validate something. You submit what you find, the judge approves or rejects. That which is approved gets collated and sent to law enforcement, and law enforcement have a much better idea of the case and something you thought was nothing might have been mentioned in a sketchy sighting or tip that could lead to a case being closed.    

*"You are Scooby Doo war dialing the internet, leave to solution of the case to the cops."*        

**Your judge and jury**
Managing and working with your judge is also important. Building some sense of trust is key. We have had some great judges that will ask us about something before they reject. If they still reject, that is fine, but if you believe in that piece of intel, do not be scared to challenge and escalate it.  

**The scoreboard**
Thoughout the CTF's I have a cardinal rule, that no one must look at the scoreboard or at least not react nor tell me (AngusRed) where we are. This ALWAYS breaks my stride and either motivates me so much my brain turns to mush or demotivates me during a dullstrom. Yes, OSINT challenges are mountains and valleys. The key to success is staying motivated and maintain your hunt even if you or your team have not submitted anything in an hour or so. On this last CTF I believe we have 1.5 hours where we had no intel to submit. Run this CTF like you are gonna be on zero points all the way, and just having fun. If you have 30 min left then sure, go have a look.  Thanks [@CyberSecStu](https://twitter.com/cybersecstu) for telling me we are doing "Really good" 3 hours in. We looked and were 5th.  

**Big picture**  
Usually on the CTF, after gaining a decent amount of intel on a subject you might soon realize you come to a point where you believe that the person might not still be missing, or worse, the subject themselves does not consider themselves missing but is merely come from a rough home and wanted to get away. This brings up a moral question in many of us. You gain intel and see the parents are gang affiliated, that drugs are at play or that circumstances where they were living were dire, and then you find a FB profile where the subject seems fine and happy, has a job and looks like they are active and doing better? In this case my thoughts are that I will continue to gather intel and get it to law enforcement via the TraceLabs crew. What should happen then is that Law Enforcement will track down the subject, consult with them and determine they are ok and that the case can be closed without disclosing to the families where the subject is.  

It also happens often where you are looking at a case and feel that this subject is no longer missing. This does happen and what you need to keep in mind is that sometimes families will not go back to law enforcement and say the subject was found and is home safely, or perhaps the missing persons database has not been updated. My suggestion is keep hunting, although it can feel a little bit creepy.  

**The many faced gods**  
One thing you will often find with missing people, especially teens is that they will have multiple social media profiles. Just because you find 1 sock account does not mean they wont have another. Sometimes with a different name, or a variation. Keep hunting! It is also common that the SOCK account will be connected to the main account. It is not always easy to spot but keep on eye on interactions and shares. After a while you could find a link to an account that has a treasure trove of intelligence.  

**Old but gold**
When I started participating in TraceLabs, or literally the first one we stuggled like hell on the 500+ day cases. After the CTF I asked some fellow participants which cases were hot and which not. We then realized that those old cases were big and that their was a huge amount of intel. A point to remember with these cases is that if you find 1 social media account of the subject post missing date, you can score big! Every photo is a *500 Pointer* and you are more likely to find an account from someone missing for a protracted period of time than one missing for 14 days.  

**Team Selection**  
Typically I feel it does not matter who is on the team, or better said, what level of experience your team mates have. What is useful is to have leadership and at least 1 person that has done this before. As long as the team is commited, and willing to stick to the plan for 6 hours and not flake out, you are in with a big shot. We have competed as 2 seperate teams, 1 team of 2, and teams of 4 with 2 team members being noobs. Yes, we all want to do well, but for a first swing, have fun with it. With time you will still have fun but will be better equiped to place highly. Setting expectations can be doubled edged. The first one we did I wanted top 100, and we were. Next I wanted top 50, and we were. The last one I wanted top 10, and we were. Yes, now our expectations are to win it, but all good things will come at their own time.    

Our team was comprised out of the following people

This was De Wet's second TraceLabs CTF and is the randomest team member. By day he is a M&A Advisor on compliance, law and tax.     


**I need tools and TOR!**  
Briefly and simply, you do not. Most of us did not use any tools. We did google dorking, you found info and followed the paths. We as a team would like to improve our understanding and use of some of the great tools out there, but you do not need them to win.  

### Case specifics and highlights from our podium finish  

On the last CTF we had a team of 4, and 2 of us had competed before. We only had 5 cases and a decent mix.    

Case 1 - We had a well known case of a mother going missing in the UK, last seen is a Off License on CCTV  
Case 2 - We had a girl in the USA from Missouri that had a history of going missing and came from a bad home    
Case 3 - We had a man that was living in Canada that was believed to have moved to the UAE (1000+ Days)    
Case 4 - We had a case of an arab woman in Canada that had not returned to the UAE    
Case 5 - Lastly we had a young girl from Texas    

Case 1 - The trouble with cases that have a huge amount of media attention is that the cases can be EXTREMELY noisy. It can be hard to wade through all the media posts and blog posts to find good intel. We struggled with the case and believed she had been living a double life.    

Case 2 - This was a valuable case. We found 2 Sock Accounts on FB and IG. This lead us to a 3rd FB account where the subject had posted just a few hours prior. We submitted a 5000 pointer (Which was rightfully rejected) when we spotted that in a video of her smoking a joint outside she was panning the camera around. After submitting for the habbit, Angus realized that there was a landmark in the background. We as a team realized this about 10 min before the cut off and managed as a team, to track down the bridge in another state. I believe with more time we could have found her exact location. The 5000 pointer was rejected becuase, to award this, TraceLabs must be able to pass the intel directly to law enforcement, and the cops should be able to go to that location and find the subject. The video was taken near a park.    

Case 3 - This case was also big for us. A big tip is to remember that with certain cultures, especially arabs or muslims that they will have variances in their names. Some might have a western name, or have their arabic name that can change over time (Like after doing their pilgrimage). We managed to find a FB account that lead to a bunch of intel. We found out after that other analysts had looked at family tree and found a post in Arabic that the subject had passed away a few months prior from COVID-19. I believe the MVP award went to a team that built a complete intel product just on this.   

Case 4 - This case was a big struggle. We managed to get passwords linked to her email and social media, and info on the local white papers along with a registered name change but this was it.   

Case 5 - If I recall here we focussed a lot on the family, but was not a very valuable case.    


### Summary  

*Taking part on OSINT of any kind is fun and exciting. Whether it is doing challenges on Hack The Box, Doing a `#OSINTCHALLENG` on twitter or tackling TraceLabs. It will give you a new skillset that you can either use in the professional world, whether that be in Infosec, HR or business. Irrespective of how deep you might go, you will gain value, even if it is merely gaining more awareness of how a bunch of small pieces of insignificant info that you post online can help a motivated analyst tracked down where you are and what you do.*  

*Team selection is not as important as team motivation. Do it with people that agree with commiting to the submission and are willing to give their everything for the 6 hour duration. Who know, maybe you place top 3!*  

*Talk to other teams that have won it like [TMHC](https://themanyhats.club/), [Shandyman and the 3 half pints](https://twitter.com/ShandymanOSINT) *The Password Inspection Agency* (Joe Gray, TJ Null, Alethe Denis etc). Talking to other teams after a CTF and seeing what they found helps teach you what you missed and how you can improve in the future.* 

*Lastly, there is always more intel. Do not give up! Keep hunting, leave no stone unturned!*  

*Something we as a community would love to do is do a TraceLabs dedicted to South African Cases, but we will need to build inroads to SAPS and related agencies*
