After many years of faithful service, Adobe announced in 2017 it would discontinue support for [Adobe Flash](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) from 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player on 12 January 2021 many have been caught unprepared. [SARS/South African Revenue Services](https://www.sars.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx) recently announced it would start using its own Browser. We aim to tackle the challenge this presents and what to think about and also why with a 2+ year warning things are not in place. <!--more-->

### What's all the tech?

[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/africa/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) announced back in 2017 that it would be EOL'ing (End of Life) Flash and this discontinue support (Including vulnerability management) and block Flash content from 12 January 2021. It stated quote:

`Since Adobe no longer supports Flash Player after 31 December 2020 and blocked Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning 12 January 2021, Adobe strongly recommends all users immediately uninstall Flash Player to help protect their systems.  

Some users may continue to see reminders from Adobe to uninstall Flash Player from their system.  See below for more details on how to uninstall Flash Player.`

End quote.



### What is flash and what is it used for?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#:~:text=Adobe%20Flash%20is%20a%20multimedia,%2C%20video%20games%2C%20and%20applications.) it states:

`Adobe Flash is a multimedia software platform used for production of animations, Rich web applications, desktop applications, mobile apps, mobile games, and embedded web browser video players. Flash displays text, vector graphics, and raster graphics to provide animations, video games, and applications. It allowed streaming of audio and video, and can capture mouse, keyboard, microphone, and camera input. ` 

An article was also published by [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/700229/adobe-flash-is-dead%C2%A0heres-what-that-means/) highlighting Adobe Flashes life and why it is going away forever.

When Flash was first introduced some 25 years ago, it was one of the only ways to make dynamic content available to the end user on the internet. Technology has vastly grown since then and the IT community saw many vulnerabilities in Flash over time. To illustrate this point, see this article by McAffee Research. Adobe has accordingly sunset Flash as of December 2020 so it was a surprise to many when the ship did not want to leave the SARS dock. For many years, SARS has used it to provide users with the ability to work with forms and do their eFilling. 


### Why is SARS continuing use of Flash and how?

Just a note on the tech here - SARS has rolled their own browser based off of chromium. I downloaded and unpacked the MSI file and there are references to chromium.


Modernisation and digitisation has become a rather steep mountain to climb that should have been a few steps on a monthly basis. Back in 2018 SARS Chief Officer for Digital and IT Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane gave an interview on SABC News after taking over from suspended commissioner Tom Moyane. The interview sadly did little to show citizens that things were being rectified.

### How does this affect me as a user?

Some good to know points we have come across:

“This field does not allow pasting on it and drag/dropping on it.”

Be sure you have your info near you and are not copying and pasting.

A tip on sharing:
You may not under any circumstances: [...] decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form
In the event that the agreement which licenses the Software to SARS terminates, then in such an event taxpayers and traders will not be permitted to use the Software under any circumstances and any such use will place taxpayers and traders at risk for infringement.

### An interesting read from a user’s perspective:

### How does this affect me and is it bad?

The three most popular browsers today are Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Vendors of these browsers spend a considerable amount of time and money keeping them secure. Despite this, bugs are frequently found in them. See for example [this](https://threatpost.com/firefox-chrome-edge-bugs-system-hijacking/162873/)

When vendors patch these bugs, IT departments frequently have control of their environment and ensure that their users update their browsers accordingly. 




### What does this mean for your tax return?

On 25 January 2021, SARS introduced a new SARS WEB BROWSER to assist with the migration from Adobe Flash Player to the HTML5 platform.  Whilst they not entirely there yet, the browser has come at a much-needed time for Taxpayers. 
Over the past few weeks Taxpayers have been very frustrated with eFiling as they were not able to access many forms due to the end of Adobe Flash Player on 31 December 2020.  Though it was announced that Adobe Flash Player would end by 31 December 2020, some browsers still continued to support in into the new year.  Taxpayers were able to continue with their filing obligations until 12 January 2021, when Adobe Flash came to a complete standstill.
Whilst SARS started with the migration process towards the end of 2020, there seemed to be some hiccups along the way.  Whilst not ideal they released a temporary workaround to assist Taxpayer with their filing obligations.  With month end looming they have been working tirelessly to find a more suitable solution.

The new browser is compatible with Microsoft Windows devices.  After numerous testing SARS has also confirmed that they are satisfied that it meets the necessary security requirements.
All forms that have not yet been migrated can now be accessed via the new browser.
These forms include the following:

DTR01 and DTR02 – dividend forms
RAV01- Amendment and verification of registered particulars, registrations
TDC01- Transfer duty
TCR01 – Tax Compliance Status Request, clearance applications
WTI – Withholding Tax on Interest

### Summary

On January 12 2021 Adobe blocked Flash Player. Since then the race has been on to deploy SARS’s latest, their own browser.
 
With Flash Player no longer supported due to it being legacy and vulnerable to potential attacks.
You can access the following forms on Adobe Flash post December 2020 included: Registration (excluding Registration for Individuals), Transfer Duty, Dividends Tax, Submission of Financial 3rd Party Data, Excise Duties and Levies.
With financial year end around the corner, SARS is under pressure for their browser deployment not to fail, with millions watching and with lots on the line, from both a cyber security risk, traffic influx to come and agile approach for any bugs that may be found.
“In the age of Covid-19, social distancing and remote working, tax practitioners, business owners and members of the public are unable to visit Sars offices and rely heavily on virtual systems to get things done. “
 
As good as this is, there are also points of awareness for individuals and companies alike. This opens up a whole new world of government based software deployment and a nation itself vulnerable to a new world of cyber and all that comes with it, both good and bad. 

So long to Adobe Flash! We are looking at a new age of digitization and modernization from online shops to South African Revenue Services. We hope you are not left uninformed and ill prepared, but find this article useful and informative.

SARS duly took note of Adobe’s notice to discontinue support for some of its products beyond December 2020. With this in mind, SARS already migrated the vast majority of its most critical forms to alternative platforms, most notably HTML5. For the reasons set out below, SARS had, until now, focused on the major tax types with the highest volumes. These are largely completed and operationally stable. While noting the discontinuation of Adobe Flash Player support, we erred in our interpretation that the functionality would continue beyond the support date.  This error has created frustration to many taxpayers to whom we owe an apology.
In addition to the high number of forms that are required to be migrated from Adobe Flash Player to the chosen HTML5 platform, the migration itself is very complex and requires the development, testing and deployment of new forms. These contain many data fields, which are underpinned by thousands of technical, administrative and complex business rules to ensure integrity of data, efficient processing and accurate assessment results. It is due to this complexity and the need to deliver properly tested and working forms that SARS prioritized the major tax types with the highest volumes with the rest planned for 2021
1. SARS has set up an eBooking system, which is accessible immediately, through our website on www.sars.gov.za in order to assist taxpayers facing challenges on how to navigate our system and where to find the necessary documents.
2. Affected taxpayers also have immediate access to a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) document on our website www.sars.gov.za to help them in fulfilling their legal obligations. The FAQs only deals with Adobe Flash Player issues.
3. By next week, SARS will establish a dedicated toll-free number specifically to provide further assistance to taxpayers. This number is only to be used resolve the Adobe Flash Player challenges. For other enquiries, taxpayers are encouraged to use the SARS Contact Centre.
4. SARS has been actively engaging the Recognised Controlling Bodies (RCBs). SARS and the RCBs are working together to find workable solutions for the tax practitioner segment. SARS has commissioned a virtual support hub to provide technical support to this cohort of taxpayers in the interim. The virtual support hub will be effective next week.

The tax authority has since moved some forms to HTML5, but others are still only available in Flash.
RAV01: Registration, amendments and verification
TDC01: Transfer duty
IT3-01: Financial certificate information
IT3-02: Financial declaration
TCR01: Tax compliance status request
DTR01: Dividends tax transactions information
WTI: Withholding tax on interest
The Sars Web browser only works on Microsoft Windows, so Apple Mac users may have to borrow a computer to do their tax filings

- SARS has, until now, focused on the major tax types with the highest volumes, such as pay-as-you-earn submissions
- SARS did not expect Adobe would “actually block” Flash Player from working
- “I am concerned that no taxes will be collected, including VAT, at the end of this month, as there is no way it can be done manually. I’m not sure if SARS is going to pull a rabbit out of a hat but maybe there is a plan,” she added.
- Adding insult to injury is the fact that owing to the second Covid-19 wave currently affecting the country, all physical SARS offices will be closed until further notice. The taxman made this announcement on 13 January.
- Shaik told Whitfield that SARS had migrated only 20 of its 44 forms that use Adobe technology, and that a further 16 should be migrated by the end of this week. Eight more will be migrated over the course of this year.
- Tax forms still to be migrated from Adobe Flash to HTML5 include, but are not limited to, those pertaining to dividend transactions, excise duties and levies, and transfer duty declarations.
