0xcon 2020 is around the corner! We have some interesting local speakers sharing the hard work they have done over the year, and a privesc challenge that will be interesting to all of us. All of this will be done online due to COVID-19, but we are setting this up to maintain the collaborative nature of the event. <!--more-->

### What is 0xcon?
We are a local infosec conference aimed towards building the Gauteng and ZA community. We welcome both experienced and new speakers alike, and work hard to keep things free and open to everyone. Details about us are at [0xcon.co.za](https://0xcon.co.za), and we have a history of past talks at [0xcon.co.za/history.html](https://0xcon.co.za/history.html).

This year's function will be on **November 14**.

### How will the 2020 event work?
We are pre-recording all the talks and will publish them to YouTube one-by-one according to the schedule we will post at [0xcon.co.za](https://0xcon.co.za). Each of the speakers will be on the Hack South Discord where you can talk to them anytime. 

### What is the challenge?
We put this together to show how vulnerabilities can be chained together to achieve a goal. You will start with some OSINT and end up with root privileges on the web server. We have prizes for the first two peeps to get root, which we will happily ship anywhere in ZA.
