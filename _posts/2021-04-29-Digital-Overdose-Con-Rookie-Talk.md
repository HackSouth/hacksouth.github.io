A journey through my first rookie talk, how I prepped for it and the details behind the amazing con, which happened on the weekend of the 17th and the 18th of April 2021.

I spoke about a topic close to me, namely the usage of technology in business, or as I put it: "Bizops in Motion".

2021 is a year of opportunity. Let's make the most of this year.

More posts to come!
