### What is this?
We will host a monthly, informal meeting occurring on the first Tuesday of every month from 6PM – 9PM. The goal is to facilitate learning for all skill levels and Hack The Box has provided us with a platform to do so. Hack The Box has given us a private, dedicated lab network where we can load any machine (Free or VIP) for the South African community to play, regardless of a paid subscription on Hack The Box.

### What do I need?
Some electricity (Yikes Eskom), a computer and an internet connection! Being the first session, we fully intend to help everybody setup virtual machines running a penetration testing distribution and help people setup a Hack The Box account. For those that do not know, Hack The Box requires you to hack your way into the site in order to create a task and although this can be extremely fun, it can also be daunting. Do no worry though as we will be walking people through this when necessary.

### What's in the box?
Well we will be choosing the first few boxes for our first Meetup but after this we will be polling which you would like to see on Discord.

### What can I expect in the future?
Following the introductory Meetup, we will be providing insight into the world of offensive security through monthly presentations. These can be anything from niche exploits, tools to add to your toolkit, guest speakers, InfoSec career development as well as a chance for you to share what you want to see in the future! This is a community driven initiative so don’t be shy to make requests!

### Are you a beginner?
You must start somewhere, so why not stop by and let us help? We encourage people to join and experience a helping InfoSec community first-hand and begin the awesome journey. Starting out can be confusing. We are happy to assist and help you get over the initial hurdles.

### Virtual machine setup
We recommend trying to setup a virtual machine before the Meetup as this will give us more time to attack the dedicated machines. Please follow the instruction video below if you can. We are happy to help set up your machine with you on the day as this will be our first session. We do ask that you try to download the software and operating system before the time.
