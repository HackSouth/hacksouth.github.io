As organizer of BSIDES Cape Town, I thought it would be good to give some updates on the past and future of BSIDES Cape Town.
We are still active, as some of you might have been wondering, planning the most out of 2021 despite lockdowns and any other surprises.
After all as the fortune cookies says: "May you live in interesting times".

## 2020 and SARS-Cov2

We had high hopes that the lockdowns would not be as dragged out as they were after the first lockdown in March. As organisers and
chairs of Bsides Cape Town organization we had to consider the health of our community, yet still attempted to organize an in person event in the background.
A combination of factors worked against us, including a busy year for all the organisers. Unfortunately we weren't able to get everything in place in time and in person events were still a no-go for us. 
We apologise to the community for missing 2020, but we aim to continue the work in the infosec community going forward. 

## 2021 and beyond
We appreciated BSIDES Cape Town as it allowed people from all over South Africa to come together in a physical location to hack, catch up and enjoy talks together.
We would still like to keep that format going, but until lockdowns are more premitting, we will keep BSIDES Cape Town 2021 an online event.
We will combine the powers of Hack South and BSIDES Cape Town, to have a confenrece running on the Hack South Discord for interaction
and YouTube.com for livestreamed talks.

We are sad to not have an in person event as focus, but also we celebrate that this opens the opportunity for international speakers.
An addition to international speakers,  many of our members who have left the country for global opportunities. We would like to encourage anyone to submit to our CFP which I will have in the next section below.

We will also have a call for workshops out soon (see below section CFW), and possibly will have the opportunity to be hosted in the physical realm.
Some workshops like lockpicking and Wifi hacking we appreciate work well in the physical rather than the virutal.

We are also working with a well known hoster of Capture the Flag (CTF) events, and will have a BSIDES Cape Town 2021 CTF running on the weekend.

Thank you for everyone's continued interest and contributions to BSIDES Cape Town. Though the lockdowns have forced more people into the
