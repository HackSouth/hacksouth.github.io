A few weeks back a few of us took part in the TraceLabs, missing person CTF. It would be our 4th shot as a **Hack South** Team, but this time, we scored a podium finish and just missed out on P2. This is that story

### What is this?
*Crowdsourced OSINT*
[TraceLabs](https://www.tracelabs.org/about/what-we-do) is crowdsource open source intelligence through both the Trace Labs OSINT Search Party CTFs and Ongoing Operations with their global community. Their highly skilled intelligence analysts then triage the data collected to produce actionable intelligence reports on each missing persons subject. These intelligence reports allow the law enforcement agencies that we work with the ability to quickly see any new details required to reopen a cold case and/or take immediate action on a missing subject.

### Why do we do it?
So the team has been a mix of people throughout the last few tournements. AngusRed has been a constant in many. We all do these for different reasons. We do these to learn a new skill that we can take into the professional world, we do this to win but always staying mindful of the real world application and effect of the result from finding previously unknown intel that can lead to someone being found, dead or alive to bring closure to the families.  

The CTF is rather bitter sweet. There are moments of cheer and exhilliration on finding a new point of entry for intelligence (Finding a new Social Media profile not found before) but we are often brought back to the stark reality of the circumstances surrounding the cases and the possible trauma this has brought to the friends, family and businesses that are affected.  

We typically start this CTF with a mindset to have fun and learn something, and then if our initial work is good, we do this to win, but that determination and result often stems from identifying and submitting high quality intelligence that can lead to finding a missing person or at least newer sources of intel for law enforcement to follow up with and either find the child/person or close a case do to passing. 

### Can I do this?
So firstly we need to understand the path to entry. Prior experience needed is none, all one needs to understand what OSINT is. Next it is advised to use things like a VM, SOCK Accounts (Social Media accounts not linked to you, ergo fake accounts). In all honesty, you could use your own accounts and a smart phone if you really had to, although it is not advised.  

Next one needs to uderstand the *"Rules of Engagement"* and the simple rule is what we call *Zero Touch* which basically means, do not interact with any of the intelligence that you find. If you find a private Instagram account, do NOT follow it. Law enforcement can run with it as they wish.  

Lastly you need to understand what the end result is. As with most forms of intelligence, you typically want to know what the end result should look like. To get to that result you will typically gain as much intel about the subject, and once that is exhausted, you start looking at ancillary people and information. Siblings, family, parents, partners, work etc etc. You can go down one path, and that can lead to another, but go down too many asides you soon find yourself down a parth of irrelevance. The way I see it is if the intel adds value, i keep upping the degrees of seperation between the subject and wherever I am, when I feel it is going nowhere I slowly step closer to the subject in degrees of seperation till I am back on the subject and can then identify new avenues.   

### What now and how do I do this? 

So now you understand what needs to happen, now what?  

TraceLabs is set up through a self built application called Saigar. Saigar is basically where cases get loaded and contestants can read up on the case and surrounding info before they start hunting. There are also pages to understand the points structure, rules and some resources along with the all mighty scoreboard.   

As the clock strikes you will have between 5-12 cases. How we do it is use a seperate discord server with a VC channel we all stay on, and then cases are broken down by their own categories. We also use a trello with 10 case "boards" and 10 sections for the various points categories. As we find intel we log them in both and with good reason. Typically I [AngusRed](https://twitter.com/AngusRedBlue) will assign cases to everyone. At about the 2 hour mark we will switch to each others cases. We work together and collaborate. We do sanity checks which typically involve corroborating that one profile matches to a certain person or profile picture.  Often the first piece of intel is the hardest, IE getting a "Foothold" on a profile of the subject. We will help each other just get a start, especially if someone gets stuck. Keeping the team motivated is key.  

### How do you win?  

This is the $400-$900 question. Below is some things I have learnt helps towards this effort.  

Hack South as a community has taken part in 4 TraceLabs Missing Persons CTF's. The first one we had 2 teams and placed 43rd and 57th respectively, the next we had 1 team that placed 31st, the next 7th and the last one we placed 3rd. The biggest change we made was understanding the points system. Understanding what can be seen as points worthy intel is key.
